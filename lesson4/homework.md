# css

1. change the "hover" so the text is larger, use font-size: 20px
2. change seat 8B to be "disabled"
3. change seat 1C to be "checked", hint: similar to the "disabled"
4. color all "isle" seats in light blue
5. make sure selection of seats as "disabled" or "checked" works and overrides the other colors, it is the most important color.
